# albertofp's dotfiles

## TODO

- [x] Add README
- [ ] ansible playbooks
- [ ] set up ansible-vault for storing SSH keys
- [ ] set up ansible-vault for storing git credentials
- [ ] set up .gitconfig

## Considerations

- Keep using Stow? Or just move completely to ansible
  - Use ansible to call stow
- Add support for both private and work githubs?
- What needs to be encrypted?
- Linting/checks in github actions?
- Does .kube/ belong in dotfiles
