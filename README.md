# albertofp's dotfiles

## TODO

- [ ] Add README
- [ ] ansible playbooks
- [ ] set up ansible-vault for storing SSH keys

## Considerations

- Keep using Stow? Or just move completely to ansible
- Add support for both private and work githubs?
- What needs to be encrypted?
- Linting/checks in github actions?
- Does .kube/ belong in dotfiles
