- improve on estimating tasks and keeping people in the loop (even if things are progressing well, keep them informed) -> it's fine if deadlines have to change, but keep stakeholders updated
- be quicker to raise concerns with teammates that are underperforming
- continue to improve on incident response (devops tickets can help, maybe talk about this to Daivik)
- midquarter checking
