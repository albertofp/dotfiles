## Questions

### Becoming better equipped to deal with incidents and be useful?
- just jump in lol
- check the main grafana dashboards (starred)
- stable events, but sharp raw user drop?
- specific to webrouter:
    - SSR cache(full page) and content cache
    - google bot latency should be low, cache hit rate high
### Long term goals to start working towards?
- external business api
- server side tracking
- next-gen serving
    - KPI: google bot latency improvements (250ms->100-150ms)
### Platform - lots of people don't have their own file. Should this be addressed?
- google group membership, data
- dont want to have to reference both github & email
### Few days off in next couple of weeks, potentially
