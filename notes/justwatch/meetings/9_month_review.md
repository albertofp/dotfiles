## Feedback for myself

### Positive

- Becoming more consistent with deliveries
- Doing a better job asking for help when needed
- More confident with releasing things
- Able to handle more complex tasks and different projects at once

### Negative

- Sometimes stuggle to finish tasks (first 90% is done very fast, last 10% drags on)
- Still not really active in incidents
- Sometimes get overwhelmed with juggling multiple tasks and fail to communicate it
- Communication to stakeholders still needs work

## Feedback for Gabi

### Positive

- Direction on prioritization has been helpful
- Technical feedback concise but thorough
- Communication to the team & team cohesion improved

### Negative

- Would appreciate more joint projects with other team members
- Planning/vision still sometimes unclear (though improving)
    - Could be interesting to have a "roadmap" of projects for the short-mid term (4-6 weeks max?)
        - helpful for motivation/focus especially when doing lower priority, less interesting work
- Regular team learning/development sessions not regular
- In the dark when it comes to hiring
    - Might be helpful/interesting for the team to have updates/input, even if just during weekly
        - e.g. backend involves everyone in the interview process
