#  3 month review

## self-review

### positive

* got onboarded relatively quickly
    * including getting used to tech I had not used before (terraform/terramate, gcp, prometheus and grafana)
* contributed to different codebases/projects (platform, business-api-external, miscellaneous like proxy server) active in tackling tickets in #devops
### negative

* still not very active or effective in incidents
* some devops tickets still take me a lot of time
* have to work on taking initiative and driving projects (re: martech observability)
    * wasted time due to misaligned priorities and goals
    * failed to communicate progress and challenges to stakeholders
* sometimes struggle with productivity when juggling different tasks on a given day
