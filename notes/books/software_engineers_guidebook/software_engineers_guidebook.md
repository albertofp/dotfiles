## Introduction

Recently I have been reading this insightful book by Gergely Orosz, who some may know from his blog/newsletter [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/) or from his other works.

This one is meant to be an introduction on how to navigate in a career in software engineering as it relates to finding fulfillment, maximizing growth and avoiding common pitfalls.

As I am currently in the earlier stages of my own career, I will focus on the sections that are most relevant to my situation. The later ones I will revisit in the future.

I should stress that these notes do not, in any way, replace the full book. I write these for my own reference, and I encourage you to [read the whole book](https://www.engguidebook.com/) for yourself if you are interested.

## Part 1: Developer Career Fundamentals

### Career Paths

There are some obvious and objective elements to one's career: job title, compensation, location. There are, however, less apparent factors, such as work/life balance, growth opportunities and how pleasant it is do work in your team.

What a "good" path is is very subjective.

**Common Types of Companies**

- _Big Tech:_ Huge, publicly traded companies like Microsoft, Apple, Netflix. These tend to offer the best benefits and compensation aswell as great growth opportunity. The hardest to get into (due to how sought after they are).

- _Medium to Large tech companies:_ Tech first companies smaller than "Big Tech". These include Shopify, Uber, Dropbox. Similar to Big Tech, with smaller user bases.

- _Scaleups:_ VC funded, late stage startups investing heavily in growth. Fast moving, high pressure. Ex.: Klarna, Notion.

- _Startups:_ Early stage companies which have raised smaller rounds of funding. Tends to offer the most freedom to engineers, but also less stability. Can be very demanding and the environment greatly depends on the founders. High risk/high reward (can win big if you own stock and the company gets acquired or has a successful IPO).

- _Traditional, non-tech companies with tech divisions:_ All kinds of companies, such as IKEA, Wallmart and Toyota. They all need tech, but here it's a cost center rather than a profit center. As a result, compensation is lower and growth opportunities might be limited. Tends to offer more job stability and work/life balance.

- _Traditional but tech-heavy companies:_ Subset of traditional companies in which tech is a major focus. They tend to be stable and mature, which comes with a rigid organizational structure and slow processes. Lower compensation than Big Techwith generally more legacy technologies and methodologies. Ex.: Cisco, Broadcom, Nokia.

- _Public sector:_ Stable and predictable and often with nice benefits. Slow, bureaucratic, and usually shackled to legacy systems.

- _Consultancies/agencies/outsourcing companies:_ Upsides: lower barrier to entry, training, varied projects. Downsides: limited growth opportunities, less focus on maintainability of the product/good practices. Ex.: Wipro, Infosys, Accenture.

- _Academia/research labs:_ Usually part of, or work closely with, universities. Upsides: working in less explored fields, little to no commercial pressure.

**Typical Software Engineering Career Paths**

The 2 most common paths: _single-track_ and _dual-track_:

- Single Track:

| Level | Individual Contributor   | Manager           |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1     | Software Engineer        |
| 2     | Senior Engineer          |
| 3     | Staff/Principal Engineer | Manager           |
| 4     |                          | Director          |
| 5     |                          | VP of Engineering |
| 6     |                          | CTO               |

At smaller companies, you will eventually hit a ceiling as an individual contributor.

- Dual Track:

At larger companies, you might not have to choose between being stuck at a certain level or pivoting into a management position.

| Level | Individual Contributor | Manager                  |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | Software Engineer      |                          |
| 2     | Senior Engineer        |                          |
| 3     | Staff Engineer         | Manager                  |
| 4     | Senior staff engineer  | Director                 |
| 5     | Principal engineer     | Senior Director          |
| 6     | Distinguished engineer | VP of Engineering        |
| 7     | Fellow                 | Senior VP of Engineering |
| 8     |                        | CTO                      |

**Compensation and "Tiers" of Companies**

Tradeoffs between tiers of companies:

| Area                     | Tier 1 (local)             | Tier 2 (top of local)   | Tier 3 (top of regional)   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| How hard to get a job    | Easiest                    | More challenging        | Very difficult             |
| Performance expectations | Low                        | Medium                  | High                       |
| Career paths as IC       | Usually up to senior/staff | Sometimes beyond staff  | Almost always beyond staff |
| Work/life balance        | Can be a focus             | Usually less of a focus | Usually less of a focus    |

**Cost Centers, Profit Centers**

A "profit center" is a team/organization within the business that directly generates revenue. Ex.: Ads org at Google and Meta. A "cost center" do not directly generate revenue, are still necessary for the operation. Ex.: Security, compliance.

Which team you join can directly affect your career prospects:

- Promotions: usually easier in profit centers, with the exception of Big Tech
- Performance reviews and bonuses: usually no difference when still entry-to-senior level. Beyond that and profit centers tend to have an easier time
- Internal transfers: profit centers are often the more "boring" teams to work for, and therefore, potentially easier to transfer into
- Attrition: cost centers almost always have a higher turnover rate
- Job security: cost centers usually are the first to be affected by layoffs

**Alternative ways to think about career progress**

Some not so obvious factors that contribute to career satisfaction:

- People whom you work with
- Your relationship with your manager
- Company culture
- Mission of the company
- Professional growth opportunities
- Mental/physical health in this environment
- Flexiblity (remote work, for example)
- Oncall
- Personal motivations

### Owning Your Career

**Be Seen As Someone Who "Gets Things Done"**

1. Get things done
2. Get _impactful_ things done: not only do a lot, but do things that actually matter to the business/team
3. Visibility: your impact has to be _noticed_. Let people know what you've accomplished

**Keep A Work Log**

It's easy for people (like your manager) to forget about work you've done. To be able to make a better case for promotion (and more easily keep the CV up to date), record work you do on a consistent basis.

**Ask And Give Feedback**

Some ways to get feedback:

- Code reviews
- Share proposals/ideas for projects, ask for feedback/thoughts
- Feedback on design documents
- Peer performance reviews (if your company does these)

Giving feedback contributes to the team's growth:

- Call out good work
- Be specific
- Only give honest feedback
- Be specific
- Avoid "giving instructions"
- Try to give negative/constructive feedback in person
- Make it clear you're on the same side
- Make it clear it's just your opinion, they are free to disregard it
- End it positively

Clarifying poorly delivered feedback:

- Ask for specific examples
- Clarify the impact the situation had
- Ask for suggestions
- If you disagree, make your case

**Make Your Manager An Ally**

They have the biggest impact on your career within a company. You cannot control how this relationship goes, but there are things you can do to improve it.

- Regular 1:1 time: catch them up with work you've been doing and share your work log. Discuss goals and how you can help the team
- Tell them, don't assume they know: they have a lot to do, they are not reviewing every PR you make.
- Understand their goals: you can take initiative on solving the most important issues.
- Deliver what you agree on, give updates when you cannot: be (and be seen as) reliable, do not make commitments you are not sure you can deliver
- Estabilish mutual trust: things are easier when people trust eachother. This is earned with time being honest and transparent.

**Pace Yourself**

Your career is going to last a long time, do not burn yourself out by taking on too much too fast. The initial high of fast learning rapid growth only lasts so long, if you try to stretch it indefinitely you are in for a bad time.

Intersperse periods of very productive, intense, focused work, with more relaxed "coasting" periods of just doing enough to get by and recharge yourself. Occasional periods of even lower performance are ok, but if it starts to drag on or happen to often, evaluate what the cause is and do something about it.

### Performance Reviews

Can be stressful exercise, but determine bonuses and eligibility for promotions. There is not much you can do last minute, so advance preparation is important:

**Start Early: Gather Context And Set Goals**

How is impact measured at your company? What is rewarded? Determine what goals are helpful for you, your team and the company.

Identify the most important factors:

- Ask your manager
- Ask experienced teammates
- Ask people with influence
- Understand how the performance review process works

Gather these details:

- Who makes the final decision?
- Who has major input? Even if they are not the one making the call, they might have meaningful input
- When does the review happen?

Discuss your goals with your manager: share your goals with your manager and ask for feedback and suggestions.

**The Power Of Habit**

Reviews happen infrequently, but your daily work is important. Make it a habit to record your wins(for example, weekly) in a work log. Share this with your manager on 1:1 meetings and get (relevant) things done.

Keep in mind to also record time spent helping others.

**Before The Performance Review**

The more formal the review process, the more time in advance you should start preparing for it.

Create a self review:

- What results you have delivered over time, remember to share older work to avoid recency bias. Work log helps
- Qualitative examples such as mentoring others
- Original goals and outcomes: reflect on goals set and achieved
- If your company has competencies listed for your role, show how you fulfill them
- Feedback from peers

**The Review**

- Remember they are a snapshot of a point in time: it is just one data point, don't get hung up on it long term
- Tends to follow a bell curve, expect average
- Biases can and do play into it
- Many people suck at giving feedback
- Be open to negative feedback and take it to heart
- Think long term, don't stress too much over an average/bad review here and there

### Promotions

Levels tend to be more well defined in bigger companies. Less so in smaller ones, but over time it becomes useful to have clear expectations for engineers of different levels of skill and impact.

**How Promotions are Decided**

Varies from company to company, but some key points tend to be similar:

- Performing at the next level: exceed expectations for your current role
- Impact at the next level: contribute large enough impact
- Business case for a promotion: business needs to have the budget available for it, sometimes it just isn't in the cards no matter how well you do
- Perception: the perception of your impact can be really important, especially in bigger orgs where individual impact is harder to pinpoint
- Support of others: promotions only happen with the decision-makers' support.
- Internal politics: more senior positions tend to be more complicated

**Advice For Getting Promoted**

- Be realistic: how was your last performance review? Did you exceed expectations?
- Understand the process: who nominates/decides, what are the criteria, which processes does the company follow?
- Talk to people who have been through the process: often things work different in reality than what the process would suggest
- Find a mentor at the next level: reach out to someone higher up than you, set up a 1:1, ask if they can share their experience of rising through the ranks and give advice/feedback
- Make an actionable plan: set goals with your manager to work towards the next level. Do it in writing and deliver on those goals
- Do not rely too much on your manager: they might leave at any time, so make sure your work is visible to more people
- _Produce, Organize, Publish_

**A Long Term Career View**

A successful career is not just about promotions and career paths can twist and turn. Look at your career in a bigger context. Some suggestions to build a succesful one, long term:

- Don't let promotions define your self worth: promotions are not based on skill alone, and envy gets you nowhere. And the higher up you go, the more fuzzy the titles get.
- Avoid shoving people out of the way: be professional and do not damage professional relationships to achieve your goals. People remember, and the tech world is a small place. Reputation matters
- Some things take time to pay off: sometimes taking a title/pay cut to work on a new tech stack/company, for example, can pay off long term
