## Introduction

Recently I have been reading this insightful book by Gergely Orosz, who some may know from his blog/newsletter [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/) or from his other works.

This one is meant to be an introduction on how to navigate in a career in software engineering as it relates to finding fulfillment, maximizing growth and avoiding common pitfalls.

As I am currently in the earlier stages of my own career, I will focus on the sections that are most relevant to my situation. The later ones I will revisit in the future.

I should stress that these notes do not, in any way, replace the full book. I write these for my own reference, and I encourage you to [read the whole book](https://www.engguidebook.com/) for yourself if you are interested.

## Part 1: Developer Career Fundamentals

### Career Paths

There are some obvious and objective elements to one's career: job title, compensation, location. There are, however, less apparent factors, such as work/life balance, growth opportunities and how pleasant it is do work in your team.

What a "good" path is is very subjective.

**Types of Companies**

- _Big Tech:_ Huge, publicly traded companies like Microsoft, Apple, Netflix. These tend to offer the best benefits and compensation aswell as great growth opportunity. The hardest to get into (due to how sought after they are).

- _Medium to Large tech companies:_ Tech first companies smaller than "Big Tech". These include Shopify, Uber, Dropbox. Similar to Big Tech, with smaller user bases.

- _Scaleups:_ VC funded, late stage startups investing heavily in growth. Fast moving, high pressure. Ex.: Klarna, Notion.

- _Startups:_ Early stage companies which have raised smaller rounds of funding. Tends to offer the most freedom to engineers, but also less stability. Can be very demanding and the environment greatly depends on the founders. High risk/high reward (can win big if you own stock and the company gets acquired or has a successful IPO).

- _Traditional, non-tech companies with tech divisions:_ All kinds of companies, such as IKEA, Wallmart and Toyota. They all need tech, but here it's a cost center rather than a profit center. As a result, compensation is lower and growth opportunities might be limited. Tends to offer more job stability and work/life balance.

- _Traditional but tech-heavy companies:_ Subset of traditional companies in which tech is a major focus. They tend to be stable and mature, which comes with a rigid organizational structure and slow processes. Lower compensation than Big Techwith generally more legacy technologies and methodologies. Ex.: Cisco, Broadcom, Nokia.

- _Small, non-venture funded companies:_ Small family businesses and bootstrapped companies. Can be a stable and relaxed place to work (without the high pressure environment of a VC funded company), at the cost of growth opportunities.

- _Public sector:_ Stable and predictable and often with nice benefits. Slow, bureaucratic, and usually shackled to legacy systems.

- _Nonprofits:_ Companies like Khan Academy and the Wikimedia Foundation. They serve a public or social cause, and usually pay less than venture-funded companies.

- _Consultancies/agencies/outsourcing companies:_ Upsides: lower barrier to entry, training, varied projects. Downsides: limited growth opportunities, less focus on maintainability of the product/good practices. Ex.: Wipro, Infosys, Accenture.

- _Academia/research labs:_ Usually part of, or work closely with, universities. Upsides: working in less explored fields, little to no commercial pressure.

**Typical Software Engineering Career Paths**

The 2 most common paths: _single-track_ and _dual-track_:

- Single Track:

| Level | Individual Contributor   | Manager           |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1     | Software Engineer        |
| 2     | Senior Engineer          |
| 3     | Staff/Principal Engineer | Manager           |
| 4     |                          | Director          |
| 5     |                          | VP of Engineering |
| 6     |                          | CTO               |

At smaller companies, you will eventually hit a ceiling as an individual contributor.

- Dual Track:

At larger companies, you might not have to choose between being stuck at a certain level or pivoting into a management position.

| Level | Individual Contributor | Manager                  |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | Software Engineer      |                          |
| 2     | Senior Engineer        |                          |
| 3     | Staff Engineer         | Manager                  |
| 4     | Senior staff engineer  | Director                 |
| 5     | Principal engineer     | Senior Director          |
| 6     | Distinguished engineer | VP of Engineering        |
| 7     | Fellow                 | Senior VP of Engineering |
| 8     |                        | CTO                      |

**Compensation and "Tiers" of Companies**

Tradeoffs between tiers of companies:

| Area                     | Tier 1 (local)             | Tier 2 (top of local)   | Tier 3 (top of regional)   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| How hard to get a job    | Easiest                    | More challenging        | Very difficult             |
| Performance expectations | Low                        | Medium                  | High                       |
| Career paths as IC       | Usually up to senior/staff | Sometimes beyond staff  | Almost always beyond staff |
| Work/life balance        | Can be a focus             | Usually less of a focus | Usually less of a focus    |

**Cost Centers, Profit Centers**

A "profit center" is a team/organization within the business that directly generates revenue. Ex.: Ads org at Google and Meta. A "cost center" do not directly generate revenue, are still necessary for the operation. Ex.: Security, compliance.

Which team you join can directly affect your career prospects:

- Promotions: usually easier in profit centers, with the exception of Big Tech
- Performance reviews and bonuses: usually no difference when still entry-to-senior level. Beyond that and profit centers tend to have an easier time
- Internal transfers: profit centers are often the more "boring" teams to work for, and therefore, potentially easier to transfer into
- Attrition: cost centers almost always have a higher turnover rate
- Job security: cost centers usually are the first to be affected by layoffs

**Alternative ways to think about career progress**

Some not so obvious factors that contribute to career satisfaction:

- People whom you work with
- Your relationship with your manager
- Company culture
- Mission of the company
- Professional growth opportunities
- Mental/physical health in this environment
- Flexiblity (remote work, for example)
- Oncall
- Personal motivations
