## Linux OS fundamentals

### Technical 

- process/process management
- package management
- linux boot process
- memory management
- shells
- hardening server
- networking
- TLS/cert authorities/how they contribute to security in networks
- load balancing (cache, cdn, lb)

### Stories

- how ive debugged stuff in real life
- approach to troubleshooting (walk through method, tools used etc)
    - tell me about a significant issue you resolved (approach, resolution steps, tools used, prevention measures)
- live problem solving of a scenario
- results (what improved/how much, what did you automate and what was the manual process)
- STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
    - start with data (hard metrics showing what the propblem was, metrics)
    - task: what was my responsibilities and constraints
    - action: what tools, processes, techniques did i use? What was the solution and how did I validate it?
    - result: metrics? business value? long term impact?

### Scripting task

- based on real world scenarios
- assess problem solving skills, understanding of automation
- any language
- basic IDE is provided with no syntax checking or debugger
- ask clarifying questions (task _may_ be intentionally ambiguous)
- discuss thought process
- consider edge cases and unexpected inputs or errors
- comments
- consider modularity and reuse
- discuss possible improvements
- how do you ensure it's maintainable
- *SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING*
- enthusiasm to learn and staying up to date with tech (-> youtube videos, blogs, books and personal projects)
