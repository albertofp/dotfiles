Basic cloud provider and IaC skills

## Multi-Cloud Deployment Automation

**Objective:** Enable deployment of the same application on multiple cloud providers.

Technologies:

- Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning.
- Cloud provider-specific Terraform providers (e.g., azurerm for Azure, aws for AWS).
- Docker for containerization.
- Kubernetes for container orchestration.

## Microservices Orchestration with Kubernetes:

**Objective:** Implement a microservices architecture using Kubernetes.

Technologies:

- Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Helm for package management.
- Docker for containerization.
- Continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) for automating deployments.

## Containerized CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:

**Objective:** Build a CI/CD pipeline for containerized applications.

Technologies:

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Docker for containerization.
- Container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry).
  -Automated testing tools (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).

## Auto-scaling Kubernetes Cluster:

**Objective:** Implement auto-scaling based on resource utilization metrics.

Technologies:

- Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for pod auto-scaling.
- Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler for cluster auto-scaling.
- Prometheus for monitoring.
- Grafana for visualization.

## Terraform Modules for Cloud Resources:

**Objective:** Create reusable Terraform modules for cloud resources.

Technologies:
Terraform for infrastructure as code.

- Terraform modules for modular and reusable code.
- Version control (e.g., Git) for managing Terraform code.

## Centralized Logging and Monitoring:

**Objective:** Set up a centralized logging and monitoring system.

Technologies:

- Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards.
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation and analysis.

## Immutable Infrastructure Deployment:

**Objective:** Implement immutable infrastructure deployment.

Technologies:

- Packer for creating machine images.
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
- Containerization tools (e.g., Docker) for application packaging.

## Infrastructure Drift Detection and Remediation:

**Objective:** Detect and remediate infrastructure drift.

Technologies:

- Terraform for defining and managing infrastructure.
- Continuous integration tools for automated testing.
- Automation scripts for drift detection and remediation.

## Blue-Green Deployments with Kubernetes:

**Objective:** Implement a blue-green deployment strategy using Kubernetes.

Technologies:

- Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Istio for advanced traffic management.
- CI/CD tools for automated deployments.

## Security Compliance as Code:

**Objective:** Implement security compliance checks using Infrastructure as Code.

Technologies:

- Terraform Sentinel or AWS Config Rules for policy enforcement.
- Security scanning tools (e.g., Trivy for container security).
- Continuous integration tools for automated checks.
