1. plating (i could do a better job of making things look visually nice, for myself)
2. colors (if i used more vegetables fruits, i could make the plate look more colorful and healthier)
3. making it with more care (example very broken fish etc, i could make it look better)
4. variety - i would enjoy it more and be healthier if i put in the time to have more food variety
5.
